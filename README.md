# Maze Solver

A Tkinter-based maze generator and solver that uses the depth-first search algorithm

## Usage

- `python main.py` will:
    - Create a window using Tkinter
    - Generate a 2D grid for the maze
    - Use depth-first traversal to break the gridâ€™s walls and generate the maze
    - Attempt to solve the maze using the depth-first search algorithm
